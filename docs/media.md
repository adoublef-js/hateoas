How to size favicons properly
The standard size for favicons is 16x16 pixels, but most designers start with 32x32 pixels to accommodate retina screens. This way, the larger favicons show up nicely on retina screens and can also be scaled down.

Of course, there are other favicon sizes out there, and itâ€™s worth mentioning that Apple-touch-icons, like those for OS Safari require dimensions of 180 x 180, Android Chrome needs a favicon at 192 x 192, and Opera Coast works best at 228 x 228. Designers generally create a variety of different sizes to accommodate both desktop browsers and other applications.
